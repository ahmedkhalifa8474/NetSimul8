# NetSimul8 is a Blue Team tool designed to help security professionals test and harden their environments.

# 🚀 NetSimul8: The Ultimate Blue Team Testing Tool

I’ve developed NetSimul8, a powerful and versatile tool designed to help Blue Teams test and harden their environments.

 It simulates real-world attacks, allowing you to identify vulnerabilities, test defenses, and improve your security posture before attackers can exploit weaknesses.

# ✨ What NetSimul8 Does

# 1. 🔍 Simulate Port Scanning Attacks

Realistic Scanning: Simulates SYN scans, UDP scans, and more to test your network’s detection capabilities.

Banner Grabbing: Retrieves service banners to identify misconfigured services.

Multi-Threaded: Quickly scans large networks to test your IDS/IPS and firewall rules.

# 2. 🚩 Simulate Brute Force Attacks

Multi-Protocol Support: Tests defenses against brute force attacks on SSH, FTP, and other common protocols.

Custom Wordlists: Use custom username and password lists to simulate realistic attack scenarios.

Alert Testing: Helps you verify if your SIEM or log monitoring tools detect brute force attempts.

# 3. 🛡️ Simulate Data Exfiltration
Custom Payloads: Simulates data exfiltration attempts to test your DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems.

Multiple Protocols: Supports TCP and can be extended to other protocols like HTTP or DNS.

Detection Testing: Helps you verify if your network monitoring tools can detect and block exfiltration attempts.

# 4. 🌐 Generate Realistic Network Traffic

Customizable Traffic: Generates realistic network traffic to test your NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems).

Stealth Mode: Simulates slow scanning and packet fragmentation to test your defenses against advanced evasion techniques.

# 5. 📦 Test Multiple Environments

Bulk Scanning: Test multiple IPs and port ranges in one run to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Automated Workflow: Saves time by automating repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on analysis and remediation.

# 6. 📊 Reporting and Logging
Detailed Reports: Generates reports in TXT or JSON for easy sharing and analysis.

Logging: Saves all findings to a log file for future reference and compliance purposes.

# 🔧 Key Features

User-Friendly GUI: Easy-to-use interface for both beginners and experts.

Customizable: Highly configurable to suit your specific testing needs.

Open Source: Fully open-source and community-driven.

# 🚀 Why NetSimul8?
Proactive Defense: Simulate attacks to identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

Comprehensive Testing: Covers a wide range of attack scenarios to ensure your defenses are robust.

Community-Driven: Built with feedback from security professionals and Blue Teamers.

# 📥 Get Started

Clone the Repository:

# git clone https://github.com/ahmedkhalifa8474/NetSimul8.git


# Install Dependencies:


 # pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run the Tool:


**python netsimul8.py**

# 📜 Example Use Cases

**1. Test IDS/IPS Detection
**
# python netsimul8.py --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 20-80

Simulates port scanning to test if your IDS/IPS detects and alerts on suspicious activity.

# 2. Test Brute Force Detection

# python netsimul8.py --target 192.168.1.1 --brute-force --protocol ssh

Simulates brute force attacks on SSH to verify if your SIEM or log monitoring tools generate alerts.

# 3. Test DLP Systems

# python netsimul8.py --target 192.168.1.1 --exfil-port 8080 --payload "Sensitive Data"

Simulates data exfiltration to test if your DLP systems can detect and block the attempt.

# 📈 Future Plans
Add More Protocols: Support for HTTP, RDP, and SMTP to expand testing capabilities.

Enhanced Stealth Features: Add IP spoofing and packet fragmentation to simulate advanced attacks.

Integration with SIEMs: Seamless integration with Splunk, ELK Stack, and other SIEM tools for automated alert testing.
